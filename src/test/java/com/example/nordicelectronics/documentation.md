## Classical vs London approach

### Chattens goatede forklaring
The approach is your testing strategy choice, not a result of existing confidence.

Classical = Strategy for testing realistic behavior → leads to confidence
London = Strategy for testing isolation → leads to precise failure location

Think of it like:

* Classical: "I want to see if this car drives well" (test with real wheels, engine, etc.)
* London: "I want to test just the steering wheel" (mock everything else)
